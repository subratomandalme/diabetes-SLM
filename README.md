# ü©∫ Basic SLM Diabetes Q&A Space

[![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](YOUR_SPACE_URL_HERE)
A simple web application hosted on Hugging Face Spaces that utilizes a Small Language Model (SLM) to answer basic questions related to diabetes based on a provided dataset.

**Disclaimer:** This application is for informational and demonstrational purposes only. It does **NOT** provide medical advice. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for any health concerns or before making any decisions related to your health or treatment.

## üåü Features

* Provides answers to common questions about diabetes.
* Utilizes a fine-tuned Small Language Model (SLM) for question answering.
* Simple and intuitive web interface (likely using Gradio or Streamlit).
* Based on the `medical_qa.csv` dataset.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This application follows a simple workflow:

1.  **User Input:** The user types a diabetes-related question into the web interface.
2.  **Frontend (app.py):** The UI framework (Gradio/Streamlit) running via `app.py` captures the input.
3.  **Backend Logic (model_runner.py):** The input is processed, potentially by helper functions in `model_runner.py`.
4.  **SLM Inference:** The processed query is fed into the fine-tuned Small Language Model.
5.  **Response Generation:** The SLM generates an answer based on its training data.
6.  **Output Display:** The generated answer is sent back to `app.py` and displayed to the user in the web interface.

## üöÄ Usage

To use the application:

1.  Navigate to the Hugging Face Space URL: [YOUR_SPACE_URL_HERE](YOUR_SPACE_URL_HERE)
2.  Wait for the application to load.
3.  Enter your question about diabetes in the provided text input field.
4.  Click the "Submit" or "Ask" button (or similar).
5.  The model's answer will appear in the output area.

## üìö Dataset

This model was trained or fine-tuned using the `medical_qa.csv` dataset included in this repository.

* **Source:** [Specify the source of the dataset if known, e.g., Public domain, specific study, etc.]
* **Content:** The dataset contains pairs of medical questions and answers, likely focused on diabetes.
* **Format:** CSV (Comma Separated Values).

## üß† Model

The core of this application is a Small Language Model (SLM).

* **Type:** [Specify the type or base model if known, e.g., Fine-tuned Flan-T5-small, custom SLM architecture, etc.]
* **Training:** The model was likely fine-tuned using the `train_slm.py` script on the `medical_qa.csv` dataset to specialize in answering diabetes-related questions.
* **Details:** [Add any other relevant details - e.g., size, specific parameters, performance notes.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **ML Framework:** [Specify, e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow]
* **Core Libraries:**
    * `transformers` (For interacting with Hugging Face models)
    * `gradio` / `streamlit` (For the web UI - specify which one you used)
    * `pandas` (Likely for data handling)
    * [Add any other key libraries from your requirements.txt]
* **Platform:** Hugging Face Spaces (for hosting)
* **Version Control:** Git / Git LFS (for handling large files)
* **Containerization (Optional):** Docker (if you used `Dockerfile.dockerfile` - remember to rename it to `Dockerfile` if using the Docker SDK on Spaces)

##  limitiations & Future Work

**Limitations:**

* **NOT Medical Advice:** This tool cannot replace professional medical consultation.
* **Knowledge Scope:** Answers are limited to the information present in the `medical_qa.csv` dataset and the SLM's training. It may not know about recent developments or highly specific cases.
* **Accuracy:** While fine-tuned, the SLM may still generate incorrect or nonsensical answers (hallucinations).
* **Basic Understanding:** The model may struggle with very complex, nuanced, or poorly phrased questions.

**Future Work:**

* [ ] Improve model accuracy with more data or a larger base model.
* [ ] Expand the dataset to cover more topics.
* [ ] Implement better handling for out-of-scope questions.
* [ ] Enhance the user interface.
* [ ] Add conversational context handling.
